# Troubleshooting and Debugging

- **Troubleshooting** : the process of identifying, analyzing and solving problems.
- **Debugging** : the process of identifying, analyzing and removing bugs in a system.

* Troubleshooting is for infrastructure
  * tcpdump, wireshark
  * strace, ltrace
  * ps, top etc
* Debugging : is for Software application
* Debugger : follows the code line by line , inspect changes in variable assignments, interrupt the program when a specific condition is met and more

**Steps to solve any issue**

* Getting Information to understand the problem
* Isolate and finding the root cause
* Performing the necessary remediation
* Document what we do
  * The different things we tested to try
  * Figure out the root cause.
  * The steps we took to fix the issue.

## `strace` & `ltrace`

_// TODO complete this section x_

**strace : to trace system calls made by the program**

* o file.strace : to save output of trace to a file

## Main steps to solving any issue ?

**Questions to Ask before debugging**

![Question to ask before debugging](../../notes-md/gitbook/assets/question_to_ask.png)

- _Isolating the root cause is super important_

# Reproduction Case

##  Refer logging 

* Linux
// TODO get types of logs to investigate in linux
  * /var/log/syslog
  * .xsession-errors
* MacOS : Library/Logs/
* Windows : EventViewer

Our solution dont come up by wandering about things, we have to look at information to plug things into our knowledge graph, looking at error messages or documentation.

- **Get a reproduction, try to isolate the problem**
- **Understanding the root cause is super important**

## Usefull Commands

### `top` & `uptime` Load Average

- Load average : amount of time the process is busy in a minute
- Load average 1 means it was busy for whole min.
- shouldnâ€™t be above the amount of process in computer
- The 3 values indicate `1 min` , `5 min`, `15 min` 
- must be less than CPU cores.

```bash
# uptime
13:36:43 up 6 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.26, 0.12, 0.04 
```

```bash 
#top
top - 15:24:23 up  1:53,  1 user,  load average: 0.08, 0.06, 0.06

```

### `iostat` :
system monitoring tool that reports CPU and I/O statistics for devices and partitions.

```bash
Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2 (skynet-e14-r3)        02/16/25        _x86_64_        (8 CPU)

### `iotop` :

Utility that displays real-time I/O usage by processes or threads on a Linux system.

```bash 
Total DISK READ:         0.00 B/s | Total DISK WRITE:         0.00 B/s
Current DISK READ:       0.00 B/s | Current DISK WRITE:       0.00 B/s

```

### `vmstat` :

Vmstat is a performance monitoring tool that provides information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, traps, and CPU activity.
- imp parameter : `wa` -> means wait time
```bash 
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- -------cpu-------
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st gu

```

### `iftop` :
iftop is a network monitoring tool that displays bandwidth usage on an interface by host.

- `time` : to calculate time taken by program to complete

user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.000s
```

- `kill` command
// TODO get types of kill commands

Like isolating causes, understanding error messages, adding logging information, and generating new ideas for possible failures.
